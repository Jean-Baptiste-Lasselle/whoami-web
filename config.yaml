    content: |
      I started as a developer many years ago.

      Since 2015, I am focused on how to develop and operate softwares in a cloud world.

      In a word, I love automating everything, and I love coding.

      I today am A **Gitops** Fanatic, an **Evangelist** in love with Cybernetics (Kubernetes Controllers, Operators, AutoScalability, self-healing abilities).

      My interests today are:
      * Designing and implementing **Infrastructure As Code** the gitops way
      * Developing **terrafrom providers**, and **terraform-compatible cloud providers**
      * Developing **Kubernetes Operators**.

      <i>**How have I become a devops?**
      I started as a developer many years ago (Java ee/JavaScript). I started as a developer many years ago (Java ee/JavaScript).
      After a few years, I soon (maven) got interested into automation, with CI/CD.
      And because CI/CD involves managing infrastructure (servers, remember Jenkins?), I completely 
      fell for infrastructure management, and automating everything. 
      
      Linux, Virtual Box, Openstack, Docker and Kubernetes, all of them came along just naturally.
      
      This how I became a devops without being aware, before the word even existed.</i>

          * **OS** : `Windows Server`,  many dockerized `Linux` distros for CI/CD.
          * **Dev stack** : I mainly used terraform and did only Infra As Code. I only had once to dive into code, to be able to shell script the full build from source of the `Dotnet` Azure Functions.

          Project Context: At Limagrain, a business critical, internally developed app, had only one envrionment, and no production env. I was in charge of building the missing production environment.

          In charge of building the production environment, I was first assigned the task of auditing the whole poject, both in terms of infrastructure, and CI/CD.
          I produced a first executive summary, providing opinionated recommandations.
          My two main recommandations were : 
          * to automate "everything": both the infrastrtucture management with terraform, and the dev CI/CD
          * to spin up isolated envrionments to promote releases from dev, to staging, UAT, up to the production.
          
          Duties and achievements:
          * I was then **in charge of implementing** my recommandations, working with the **Dev Team (5 developers), on one end, and the core infrastructure teams** (compute, identity, network, security teams), on the other hand.
          * I was invited to **architecture labs**, to give a **talk on terraform and infrastructure as code concepts**. My talk was very appreciated, so that other departments requested to have knowledge sharing workshop with me.
          * I was required to attend the validation gates meetings, required to allow the app to go to production. My role was to **answer the question about infrastructure and automation design** choices details.
          * Terraform was not used at all in the project, and I **convinced** the management, and the core infrastructure teams, **to start using terraform for infrasructure management**, especially in **production**.
          * In less than 4 months, I brought up with `terraform`, 3 new isolated environments, DEV, UAT and production. I also found and solved a couple of very complex issues integrating `Azure` cloud components and `Microsoft Dynamics`.
          * The `terraform` achievements, my **evangelist** conviction, added to the support of the new architect in the Dev team, and the project managers, resulted in a real victory: In January 2024, several dedicated Azure subscriptions were given to the Dev Team department, where initially a single Azure subscription had to be shared with other departments!

          Project Context: At Michelin,  Data Engineering / AI Project

          I was in charge of managing all Azure resources with **terraform** (Azure Storage Accounts, vnet/sbnets, VMs, managed identities, service principals, etc...)
          I was involved with 2 Data engineer SMEs, to **re-design and implement** the whole 
          **Data Engineering platform**. I was working on the CI/CD scope. The new design involved a **migration from** an **{Azure Data Factory / ADF Pipelines} stack**, to a much 
          more advanced, Python-based, **{Databricks + Snowflake} Stack**.

          The new data engineering platform processed data by executing Python code, and therefore needed a fully fledged Python CI/CD.
          
          Duties and achievements:
          * Managing of **Azure** resources with `terraform`: Databricks workspaces, Azure Account Storage, networks, Azure Key Vaults, Managed Identities, R-Studio VMs, MongoDB clusters, etc...
          * **Modularization of terraform code**, management of terraform state: **terraform modules**, terraform private registry, terraform state into Azure Account storage container
          * Design of **CI/CD Modules**, **CI/CD runners** Docker images (Python code)
          * Design of **CI/CD Pipelines**: **Git workflows**, **Gitlab** release automation with `gitlab-cli`, **python** packages deployment to databricks (**databricks scheduled jobs**), snowflake (with liquibase).
          * Design of **Documentation**: `astro`/`hugo` documentation repo with automation based on Gitlab CI/CD pipelines.

          CD, migrating from Jenkins to Circle CI on the way.
          I today am a top expert about Circle CI and Gitops based approaches.
          I am extremely proud that I had the opportunity to work with the https://gravitee.io Team, a World Class Team of
          Software Engineers, from which i deeply learned about many topics.
          I also there learned a lot about what is, and what brings, cybernetics in the real cloud industry world. In particular, it is there that i started working on Kubenetes Operators.

          * `Kubernetes` SME
          * Full design, implementation, and migration of the whole of the Gravitee CICD System. In particular, I had to design and implement a very unique CICD component, using `NodeJS`, `TypeScript`, `RxJS`, a component to orchestrate Pipeline executions in a multi git repository context, bringing scalability and removing Single Points of Failures.

          In charge of datacenter deployment automation and operations in the context of the new `5G` network deployment.

          * I worked on designing and deploying a full devops stack, for developers to git push their `Python` source code, ending with their code deployment to production Cisco NSO devices. I even had, on the SFR request, to build from source docker registry it self : SFR needed its CICD platform to be "fully built from source" (docker, registry, etc.), and that, for security constraints.
          * I was a CI/CD evangelist on this `Cisco NSO` project (networks engineers do not have the same culture as Dev Engineers, to say the least). This included introducing and training network engineers on git, and why Gitlab and Gityhub are our everyday Facebook (As I use to say, _`Facebook` is our today’s real office_).
          * I designed git workflows, trained on how to operate Gitlab EE as an infrastructure on premise : software engineers at SFR, were in charge of operating their own Gitlab EE.

          interesting, for I worked there with people who never ever worked in software development. I would say

          R&D main goal was to design and develop an cutting edghe network monitoring system.

          What was thrilling and extremely interesting in this experience, is that the system did not monitor
          software, but hardware, and in paritcular, the system goal mainly was to monitor Fiber Optics and
          Copper cables failures !

          The developed Monitoring system consisted in both hardware and software : pure Linux OS, java and C
          language.

          * I worked on the software part which was the « brain » of the monitoring system : the server that collects all data from distributed systems, analyze them, and manages alerts, using JCA Components in a Jee JBoss EAP app.
          * I introduced there bare metal provisioning : `PXE-` booted to deploy the whole stack, and i automated all that to be able to run reliable testing. That was my answer to « it is not possible to fully automate our solution deployment ».
          * I introduced and convinced of the necessity of Acceptance Tests.
          * I developed an authentication module implemented using `Jee` Listeners and `Spring` modularization
          * I brought in `Docker`-ized deployments, the internal use of Pipelines using Gitlab on premises, the Java deployment happening in `JBoss EAP` (`Angular` 8/9 + `bootstrap` Web UI).
          * Geolocation of hardware failures, so GIS matters, I introduced Leaflet on the Web UI This experience was a turning point for me : That is were I worked months with whom I consider my master as far as *NIX and what OS actually are, a « Linux Wizard » , **Eric Lévenez**, a man I will always remember.

          SPVC was an SMB of the contruction industry, specialized into fluids.

          I designed the first real Information System, conducted and took part in developments of software
          components required to deliver that first I.S.

          I thereafter structured the newly created IT department to be fit for production management.
          All in all, this was among my most craziest professional experiences, that made me learn a lot about
          who i am in the IT industry.

          Also my first experience as a pure Software guy, putting his hands unawarely into infrastrucutre.
          And finally, this is the point where I started there changing the way i definded my self : at that point, I
          used to say that i am a « FullStack » Architect.

          * The Work began with the desing and implementation of a simple utility software, whose goal was to normalize Business Processes, especially for the commercial and build sites managers everyday tasks.
          * I then made it production « almost » ready, by adding to it the seed of a DRP. The implemented services were relation to construction project management : Gantt Charts, Tasks Management, reporting.
          * A second generation, redesigned IS turned it into a B.A.M. system (Business Activity Monitoring) using :
            * The Acitviti `BPMN` engine.
            * A `JBI` ESB coupled to the BPMN engine, SOA architecture (all `BPMN` execution were invoked through the ESB, using JAX-WS / JAX-RS).
            * 15 users in January 2014, up to 30 end of 2014, then 40 end of 2015.
            * As I first talked of the critical importance of a DRP, i was certainly not realizing how deeply I would dive into infrastructure management...
          * I built month weeks after weeks a small team consisteing of 3 to 5 developers and ops, I was the software architect with 2 developers, and manager for the 2 / 3 ops engineers (system enginrer, security engineer, network engineer).
          * I was personnaly working on the CI system a classical recipe of `Git`, `Maven`, `Jenkins` (`Junit`, `DbUnit`, `Mockito`, etc...), Artifactory. All classics of that prehistorc times.
          * One unthinkable thing happened there, where i lerned a lot about real infratructure , I conducted and designed a full server room: SPVC used on premises servers, the IS being used by employees from their tablets mainly (MTT french trademark Android tablet). A crazy experience where i learned what a datacenter really is, e.g. what material are used on the floor (epoxy) of datacenters, Server Hardware Benchmark, network backbone, DRP with FM200 fire systems, air colling, electricity etc...

          At the heart of Michael Page’s IT Department (EMEA), I took part in the full revamping of Michael Page’s Inforamtion system, along with 10 à 15 Java Dev Engineers, 2/3 IT Architects, QA and 10 Business Analysts.

          My personal scope was focused on the « backend » part of all software responsible for Candidates Processes Management, including the Candidates Assessment. This was my first professional
          experience into a major large scale IT Department of an International Corporation.

          * In collaboration with IT Architects, and Business Analysts, I designed and implemented the "candidate assessement" components. That made me an SME on the Candidate Assessment functional scope.
          * Learned a lot on HR Business Process in the real world
          * Classic Java developmen, involving CI, using Maven, JUnit, on premise Nexus Sonatype repo. Some Java dependencies had to be « mavenized », some others already were.
          * I took part in a huge Security Operation, because of a discovered major intrusion attack in Michael Page Information System, a long memorable pizza week-end...
          * I started there being involved into topics of CI/CD and it the Infrastructure it relies on.
          * I worked on a proposal for using the Fractal Julia Framework to refactor functional units along the IS revamping process.
