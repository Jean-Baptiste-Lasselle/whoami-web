    content: |
      At University, I studied pure mathematics.

      I started IT as a developer.

      2015, I turned my focus on infrastructure (as code), and the cloud world.

      I love coding and automating everything.

      I today am a **Cloud Engineer/SRE**, an **Evangelist** in love with **Gitops** and Cybernetics (Kubernetes Controllers, Operators, AutoScalability, self-healing abilities).

      My interests today are:
      * Designing and implementing **Infrastructure automation**: make it as autonomous as possible.
      * Developing **terraform providers**, **OpenBAO utilities**
      * Developing **Kubernetes Operators**.
      * Landing Zones: What comes after the Cloud Adoption Framework ?

      <i>**How have I become a devops/cloud engineer?**
      After a few years as developer, I soon got interested into automation with CI/CD (maven).
      Because CI/CD involves managing infrastructure (servers, remember Jenkins?), I was pulled into infrastructure management, and completely 
      got into automating infrastructure ops. 
      
      Linux, Virtual Box, Terraform, Openstack, Docker and Kubernetes, all of them just came along naturally.</i>

          Project Context: At Limagrain, a business critical, internally developed app, had only one environment, which was manually built.
          I was in charge of building all environments, with automation.
          
          * **Tech stack** : `Terraform`, `Helm`, `kubectl`, `Docker`, `Azure AKS / App Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)`, `Azure Functions`, `Azure CosmoDB`, `Azure EventHub`, `Azure Devops (Pipelines)`, `Azure Managed identities / Service Principals`, `Azure networking - vnet, subnets, private endpoints`, `Artifactory`, shell scripting (`sh`, `bash`).
          
          I was first assigned the task of auditing the whole project, both in terms of infrastructure, and CI/CD, with an executive summary as deliverable.
          My two main recommendations were : 
          * to automate "everything": both the infrastructure management with terraform, and the dev CI/CD
          * to spin up isolated environments to promote releases from dev, to staging, UAT, up to the production.
          
          Duties and achievements:
          * I was **in charge of implementing** my recommendations, working with the **Dev Team (5 developers), on one end, and the core infrastructure teams**, on the other hand.
          * I was invited to **architecture labs**, to give a **talk on terraform and infrastructure as code concepts**. My talk was very appreciated, so that other departments requested to have knowledge sharing workshops with me.
          * I was required to attend the validation gates meetings: the process to allow the app to go to production. My role was to **answer the question about infrastructure and automation design** choices details.
          * Terraform was not used at all in the project, and I **convinced** the management, and the core infrastructure teams, **to start using terraform for infrastructure management**, especially in **production**.
          * In less than 4 months, I brought up with `terraform`, 3 new isolated environments: DEV, UAT and production. I also found and solved a couple of very complex issues integrating `Azure` cloud components and `Microsoft Dynamics`.
          * The `terraform` achievements, my **evangelist** work, added to the support of the project managers, resulted in a real victory: In January 2024, several dedicated Azure subscriptions were granted to the Dev Team department, where initially a single Azure subscription had to be shared by all departments!

          In charge of managing all Azure resources with **terraform** (Azure Storage Accounts, vnet/sbnets, VMs, managed identities, service principals, etc...)
          **Re-designing and implementing**, with 2 Data engineer SMEs,  the whole 
          **Data Engineering platform**. I was working on the CI/CD pipelines scope. The new design involved a **migration from** an **{Azure Data Factory / ADF Pipelines} stack**, to a much 
          more advanced, Python/PySpark-based, **{Databricks + Snowflake} Stack**.

          The new data engineering platform processed data by executing Python code, and therefore needed a fully fledged Python CI/CD.
          
          Duties and achievements:
          * Managing of **Azure** resources with `terraform`: Databricks workspaces, Azure Account Storage, networks, Azure Key Vaults, Managed Identities, R-Studio VMs, MongoDB clusters, etc...
          * **Modularization of terraform code**, management of terraform state: **terraform modules**, terraform private registry, terraform state into Azure Account storage container
          * Design of **CI/CD Modules**, **CI/CD runners** Docker images (Python code)
          * Design of **CI/CD Pipelines**: **Git workflows**, **Gitlab** release automation with `gitlab-cli`, **python** packages deployment to databricks (**databricks scheduled jobs**), snowflake (with liquibase).
          * Design of **Documentation**: `astro`/`hugo` documentation repo with automation based on Gitlab CI/CD pipelines.

          In charge of datacenter deployment automation and operations in the context of the new `5G` network deployment.

          Duties and achievements:
          * I worked on designing and deploying a full devops stack, for developers to git push their `Python` source code, ending with their code deployment to production Cisco NSO devices. I even had, on the SFR request, to build from source docker registry it self : SFR needed its CI/CD platform to be "fully built from source" (docker, registry, etc.), and that, for security constraints.
          * I was a CI/CD evangelist on this `Cisco NSO` project (networks engineers do not have the same culture as Dev Engineers, to say the least). This included introducing and training network engineers on git, and why Gitlab and Github are our everyday Facebook (I used to say, _`Facebook` is our today's real office_ - and by _"Facebook"_ I meant Github/Gitlab-like platforms).
          * I designed git workflows, trained on how to operate Gitlab EE as an infrastructure on premise : software engineers at SFR, were in charge of operating their own Gitlab EE.
          * I took a `Cisco NSO` training session at Cisco, on how to automate bare metal provisioning of Cisco NSO Clusters, in « Issy les Moulineaux » a French city close to Paris.
          * With those duties, I worked with more than 100 engineers, coming from 3 different teams :
            * pure Infrastructure team (those who own the OpenStack),

          I took part into 3 projects with Bosstek, for 3 different French Customers. This experience was very
          interesting, for I worked there with people who never ever worked in software development. I would say
          they were from the « old style » infrastructure world, and that is why i had a lot to learn with them.

          * I have been Dev Engineers Team Leader At SOPRA STERIA, where I worked under the authority of David Maurange.

            * Production grade Kubernetes Cluster Ingress Controller best practices.
            * A proposed solution of system monitoring with Rsyslog/Elastic Stack, (with a focus on CA servers restarts) : purpose was to have the company certified as a CA Authority delivering SSL/TLS certificates.

          Context: R&D fault detection in fiber optics large networks (OTDUs).

          * **Tech stack** : `Ansible`, `PXE boot`, `PXE boot kickstart installations`, `Docker`, `Virtual Box`, `KVM`, `Free IPA Server`, `SSH` / `SCP`/ `WinSCP`, with a lot of bin/bashing.
          * **CI stack** : Gitlab, Artifactory, MAVEN3 Git, Eclipse JBoss Tools, Jenkins, Checkstyle, JMeter, JUnit, DbUnit, Jasmine + Karma, Wireshark & wireshark dissectors
          * **Dev stack** : Java, JCA IronJacamar, JPA, Hibernate, WILDFLY, EJB3 Stateless & MDBs', JAX-RS & Resteasy, Apache Shiro, Leaflet, Angular, Linux Pluggable Authentication Mechanism, mariadb, postgresql/postgis, .Net Windows Service Application component, Visual Studio.

          Java Dev Enginer at Vierling-Communication, an R&D company of the « Laudren Group » .
          R&D main goal was to design and develop a cutting edge network monitoring system.

          What was thrilling and extremely interesting in this experience, is that the system did not monitor
          software, but hardware, and in particular, the system goal mainly was to monitor Fiber Optics and
          Copper cables failures !

          The developed Monitoring system consisted in both hardware and software : pure Linux OS, java and C
          language.

          Duties and achievements:
          * I worked on the software part which was the « brain » of the monitoring system : the server that collects all data from distributed systems, analyze them, and manages alerts, using JCA Components in a Jee JBoss EAP app.
          * I introduced there bare metal provisioning : `PXE-` booted to deploy the whole stack, and i automated all that to be able to run reliable testing. That was my answer to « it is not possible to fully automate our solution deployment ».
          * I introduced and convinced of the necessity of Acceptance Tests.
          * I developed an authentication module implemented using `Jee` Listeners and `Spring` modularization
          * I brought in `Docker`-ized deployments, the internal use of Pipelines using Gitlab on premises, the Java deployment happening in `JBoss EAP` (`Angular` 8/9 + `bootstrap` Web UI).
          * Geolocation of hardware failures, so GIS matters, I introduced Leaflet on the Web UI This experience was a turning point for me : That is were I worked months with whom I consider my master as far as *NIX and what OS actually are, a « Linux Wizard » , **Eric Lévenez**, a man I will always remember.

          SPVC was an SMB of the contruction industry, specialized into fluids.

          I designed the first real Information System, conducted and took part in developments of software
          components required to deliver that first I.S.

          I thereafter structured the newly created IT department to be fit for production management.
          All in all, this was among my most craziest professional experiences, that made me learn a lot about
          who i am in the IT industry.

          Also my first experience as a pure Software guy, putting his hands unawarely into infrastructure.

          * The Work began with the design and implementation of a simple utility software, whose goal was to normalize Business Processes, especially for the commercial and build sites managers everyday tasks.
          * I then made it production « almost » ready, by adding to it the seed of a DRP. The implemented services were relation to construction project management : Gantt Charts, Tasks Management, reporting.
          * A second generation, redesigned IS turned it into a B.A.M. system (Business Activity Monitoring) using :
            * The Acitviti `BPMN` engine.
            * A `JBI` ESB coupled to the BPMN engine, SOA architecture (all `BPMN` execution were invoked through the ESB, using JAX-WS / JAX-RS).
            * 15 users in January 2014, up to 30 end of 2014, then 40 end of 2015.
            * As I first talked of the critical importance of a DRP, i was certainly not realizing how deeply I would dive into infrastructure management...
          * I built month weeks after weeks a small team consisteing of 3 to 5 developers and ops, I was the software architect with 2 developers, and manager for the 2 / 3 ops engineers (system enginrer, security engineer, network engineer).
          * I was personnaly working on the CI system a classical recipe of `Git`, `Maven`, `Jenkins` (`Junit`, `DbUnit`, `Mockito`, etc...), Artifactory. All classics of that prehistorc times.
          * One unthinkable thing happened there, where I learned a lot about real infratructure , I conducted and designed a full server room: SPVC used on premises servers, the IS being used by employees from their tablets mainly (MTT french trademark Android tablet). A crazy experience where i learned what a datacenter really is, e.g. what material are used on the floor (epoxy) of datacenters, Server Hardware Benchmark, network backbone, DRP with FM200 fire systems, air cooling, electricity etc...
